# MoA (Mechanisms of Action)

## What is MoA?
According to Widipedia definition In pharmacology, the term mechanism of action (MOA) refers to the specific biochemical interaction through which a drug substance produces its pharmacological effect. A mechanism of action usually includes mention of the specific molecular targets to which the drug binds, such as an enzyme or receptor.

So in simple terms what kind of receptor or enzyme a drug will bind with is called MoA.

## Target
We are given some data related to drug (what data we will see later) and we are given data that particular drug in given row affects which enzymze or receptor etc. There are total 206 different types of receptors given which drug could bind with so 1 represent binding 0 the opposite.

so our task is to use this data to make a model which could predict to which receptors the unknown drug will bind to

## Files Required to re-run the Project
a) Original Dataset present in folder /MoA_data

b) Jupyter Notebook for Running of code

NOTE: If you have GPU available, please use as it will help in quick train of model
